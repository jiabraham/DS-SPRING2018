This is a fully functional circular doubly linked-list in which the first and last nodes are connected and there are next and previous references. If nodes are added in a particular order by payload(least to greatest, greatest to least, alphabetical), then search effectively has better than O(N) performance due to having both next and previous references. Overhead of having both of these references is truly worth the benefit of better lookup when there is a large number of nodes. This project reflects knowledge of Java and specifically the linked-list data structure.
