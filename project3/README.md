This project is a solution to a problem given by Professor Joanna Klukowska titled Wayfinder. The problem is given some array with positive integers, how many ways can we move from the zeroth index of the array to the last index? The way in which we were able to move is for some integer n that was an element of the array, we were allowed to "move" n indices forward or backward given that you stayed in the bounds of [0,n-1]. The last element of the given array was always zero as a signal that the program had reached a viable solution. This required a recursive algorithm in that after the first move, the path diverged into two because it must be considered that a viable way to the end would be moving forward or backwards with every element except for the first one (the first index was only able to be added because subtracting would result in an out of bounds error).
