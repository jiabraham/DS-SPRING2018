This projects reflects knowledge of the Java and specifically the AVL tree data structure, object oriented programming, and search with O(log(n)) complexity. The only standard data structure with more efficiency is a hash table which has O(1) lookup. NYS Baby names takes input from a file containing the baby names of different counties in New York and organizes them into an AVL tree. Each name is sorted alphabetically and counts are done to know how many unique names were used in a given county and the entire state.
